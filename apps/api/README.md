# StellarCrop API

StellarCrop puts warehouse receipts on-chain using Stellar's native asset issuance. A warehouse operator registers a Batch, uploads the WarehouseReceipt, issues Stellar tokens for the commodity, and manages a KYC-gated Investor allowlist. When the commodity is sold, proceeds flow on-chain to every token holder.

StellarCrop API is built on the Arkstack Express framework, and framework documentations are available from [https://arkstack.toneflix.net](https://arkstack.toneflix.net/).
